# User Agent Parser Comparison

This application was put together to assist us in making a decision on which UserAgent parsing library to use, and then modified some to be a bit more user-friendly to encourage use among the different parsing library maintainers.  It's still a bit work in progress, but in its current state it's very useful at benchmarking the different parsing libraries (across different languages) and comparing the results of the parsers against "known" useragents (right now these come from the parser libraries' unit tests, but a known list could be built and tested against).
